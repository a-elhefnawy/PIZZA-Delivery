## PIZZA-Delivery 
My current project is a web page for pizza delivery that I'm building using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. The goal of the project is to apply everything I've learned so far and create a user-friendly website that provides a great experience for the user.
I started building the website using HTML and CSS, and I am  adding Bootstrap to improve the layout and responsiveness of the site, Next, I am working on the functionality of the website using JS
